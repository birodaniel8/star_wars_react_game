### Instructions:

The goal of this game is to get to a randomly selected target character from another randomly selected initial
character in the least amount of steps.

In each step you can see a card with many properties and clicking on these properties will lead you to a new
card with new information (e.g. selecting the 'homeworld' will show additional info the planet itself or
selecting the 'yellow' eye property will list characters with yellow eyes).

Note that each category can only list 5 related items (the movie card will not show you all characters in that
movie but 5 randomly selected ones).

In the 'explore' mode you don't play a game, however all items in a category are listed to explore the Star
Wars galaxy.
